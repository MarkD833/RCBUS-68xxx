# The RCBus
RCBus is an extended version of the [RC2014&trade;](https://rc2014.co.uk/) bus that was put together by members of the [retro-comp](https://groups.google.com/g/retro-comp) google group. The latest RCBus specification as of Oct 2025 is v1.0 and can be found [here](https://smallcomputercentral.com/rcbus/).

My boards are designed around the RCBus 80 pin format in order to support the additional address and data signals.

# Zilog Compatability
There is no intention to support any Zilog specific chips such as the PIO, SIO, CTC or KIO as their signals and timing are just too different. The PIO and SIO have equivalents in the MC68230 and MC68681 chips. The KIO has a sort-of equivalent in the MC68901. A CTC chip may not be needed as the MC68230 and MC68681 have their own timers and the MC68901 has 4 simple timers.

# The Boards
The boards below are my current suite of MC68xxx processors and peripherals. There are no surface mount devices or programable logic devices (PALs, GALs, CPLDs etc) in my design. The only programmable devices are the 2 EEPROMs containing my own simple monitor program and optionally CP/M-68K v1.3 and EhBASIC.

The board dimensions should be the size of an RCBus "medium" module as detailed in the RCBus specification v1.0 - roughly 4in x 2.1in excluding the edge connector. All the boards are 4-layer boards with +5V and GND on the inner 2 layers.

There are more details of each board in the boards folder.

## MC68000 CPU Board
This board consists of a PLCC packaged MC68000 processor, bits of glue logic and the processor clock source. The glue logic handles autovector interrupts, generates the /BERR signal and provides the /DTACK signal for the RCBus MREQ and IORQ address spaces as well as the the RCBus /MREQ, /IORQ, /RD & /WR signals.

Devices that are addressed outside of the RCBus MREQ and IORQ address range must supply their own /DTACK signal.

## MC68302 CPU Board
This board consists of a 132-pin PGA packaged MC68302 processor, bits of glue logic and the processor clock source. The glue logic primarily generates the RCBus /MREQ, /IORQ, /RD & /WR signals. The board features 2 serial ports and an SPI port as well as autovector interrupts. 

A /DTACK generator is not required as the MC68302 has internal logic to automatically generate a /DTACK for any address within the address rance of each of its 4 chip select signals.

Similarly, a /BERR generator is not required as the MC68302 has an internal hardware watchdog timer that is enabled at reset and will generate a Bus Error if a /DTACK isn't generated by the internal chip select logic or an external device.

## MC68681 SIO Board
This board consists of a pair of 40-pin DIL MC68681 serial I/O chips and associated address decode logic as well as a crystal oscillator for the baud rate generators. This combination provides four serial ports, two 16-bit timer/counters as well as 16 digital outputs and 12 digital inputs.

## MC68230 PIO Board
This board consists of a pair of 48-pin DIL MC68230 parallel I/O chips and associated address decode logic. This combination provides 32 individually programmable digital I/O pins with up to 16 additional digital I/O pins depending on the port C functionality required and two 24-bit timer/counters.

## MC68901 MFP Board
This board consists of a pair of 48-pin DIL MC68901 multifunction chips and associated address decode logic. This combination provides 16 individually programmable digital I/O pins, eight 8-bit timers and two serial ports.

## Memory Board v1
This ROM/RAM board is designed for two Winbond W27C512 EEPROMs to provide 128K of non-volatile memory organised as 64K of 16-bit wide memory and two Alliance Memory AS6C4008 RAM chips to provide 1M of volatile memory organised as 512K of 16-bit wide memory. The board also includes address decode logic and a simple /DTACK generator.

## Memory Board v2
This ROM/RAM board is designed for two SST39SF040 FLASH memory chips to provide 1M of non-volatile memory organised as 512K of 16-bit wide memory and two Alliance Memory AS6C4008 RAM chips to provide 1M of volatile memory organised as 512K of 16-bit wide memory. The board also includes address decode logic and a simple /DTACK generator.

By reconfiguring the boards jumpers, the board will support four SST39SF040 FLASH memory chips to provide 2M of non-volatile memory organised as 1M of 16-bit wide memory or four Alliance Memory AS6C4008 RAM chips to provide 2M of volatile memory organised as 1M of 16-bit wide memory.

# Address Map
The current address map is as follows:

| Address Range | Device | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0x000000..0x01FFFF | EEPROM | Fixed address range<sup>1</sup> |
| 0x100000..0x1FFFFF | SRAM | Fixed address range<sup>1</sup> |
| 0x000000..0x5FFFFF | FLASH | Jumper selectable address range<sup>2</sup> |
| 0x000000..0x5FFFFF | SRAM | Jumper selectable address range<sup>2</sup> |
| 0xD00000..0xD03FFF | DUARTs | Jumper selectable options |
| 0xD08000..0xD0BFFF | PI/Ts | Jumper selectable options |
| 0xD10000..0xD13FFF | MFPs | Jumper selectable options |
| 0xF00000..0xF7FFFF | RCBus /MREQ | Fixed address range<sup>3</sup> - partially decoded |
| 0xF80000..0xFFFFFF | RCBus /IORQ | Fixed address range<sup>3</sup> - partially decoded |
| 0xFC0000..0xFCFFFF | RCBus /MREQ | Fixed address range<sup>4</sup> |
| 0xFD0000..0xFDFFFF | RCBus /IORQ | Fixed address range<sup>4</sup> - partially decoded |

1. These addresses apply to the ROM/RAM V1 board
2. These addresses apply to the ROM/RAM V2 board
3. These addresses apply to the MC68000 board
4. These addresses apply to the MC68302 board

# Testing
The 68000 board, the ROM/RAM v1 board, the serial I/O board and the MFP board are working and a small monitor program is running that allows me to download Motorola S-records. Both S2 (16-bit) & S3 (24-bit) record types are handled although in reality only S3 records make sense with the current memory configuration.

The 68302 board has a version of my small monitor program running on it with the main serial I/O via SCC1.

The ROM/RAM V2 board has been assembled but remains untested.

The 68230 board has had some issues relating to how the chip select signal is generated. A simple wiring change appears to have resolved this.
 
The monitor currently supports a few of the EASy68K TRAP #15 text I/O functions - currently just tasks 0, 1, 5, 6, 13 & 14 - which are all related to text input/output. Further tasks may be added as I need them.

# RCBus Compatability
I have a number of Steve Cousin's RC2014&trade; / RCBus boards that I have been able to use successfully in the 68000 system. The code folder holds some example code for these boards as well as CP/M-68K v1.3 using the CompactFlash storage.

The SC145 & SC729 CompactFlash modules have both been tested with CP/M-68K v1.3 and appear to operate correctly.

I've ported part of J B Langston's [TMS9918A code](https://github.com/jblang/TMS9918A/tree/master) to work with Shiela Dixon's [TMSEMU RCBus video card](https://peacockmedia.software/RC2014/TMSEMU/). There are now several demos working as I've slowly added more functionality to the TMS library. Some demos have also been ported from assembler to C along with modifications to the library to support C function calls.

# Software Development
All of the early software - i.e. the monitor program - was developed and initially tested using EASy68K & SIM68K under Windows 10.

I've now moved my development across to a Linux Mint system and discovered that EASy68K doesn't particularly like running under WINE. Luckily I still have a Windows 10 PC available.

I've now switched to using GCC to compile C and C++ programs.

I've managed to correctly configure the objdump tool to generate an assembler listing file that can then be modified by the Linux SED command such that SIM68K will accept the file and I can debug C++ code running on SIM68K.

# Hardware Library
I'm not a C++ programmer so I figured I would try and learn about C++ and classes and decided to throw myself in at the deep end - the really deep end!

Having returned to the world of microcontrollers by playing around with some Arduino UNO boards, I figured that I might try and create some hardware libraries in the style of Arduino.

Currently I have a serial port library that provides similar functionality to some of the functions in the [Arduino Serial class](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/serial/) that supports the dual MC68681 SIO board.
