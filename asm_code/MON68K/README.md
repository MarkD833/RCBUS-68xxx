# RCBUS MC68000 Simple Monitor

This folder contains the simple monitor program I created to support my RCBus 68000 system.

NOTE: This monitor is not compatible with my 68302 board.

The current version of the monitor is v1.3 and it supports both CP/M-68K and EhBASIC.

Note that CP/M-68K and EhBASIC are separate applications. It's on my list to provide a pair of BIN files for the 2 PROMs that includes CP/M-68K and EhBASIC with the monitor program.
