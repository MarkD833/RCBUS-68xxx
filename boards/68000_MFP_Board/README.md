# Thoughts
+ Should the MFPs each have their own choice of interrupt level?
# Physical Board
+ Experiment to find the maximum width of board that JLCPCB will accept to keep the
  low price.
+ Modify the RCBus80 medium board footprint in Kicad so that pins 1,40,41 & 80 don't
  throw DRC warnings/errors.
