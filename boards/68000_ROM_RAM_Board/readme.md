Be careful where you source these devices from. I bought mine from AliExpress and they were sold as new. In fact they were salvaged from boards and the IC legs were tinned with solder. This makes the pins slightly "sticky" when you insert the chips into IC sockets. My experience with these chips is that you may get 6-10 insertions/removals before the IC socket spring contacts start to break.

# To Do
+ Experiment to find the maximum width of board that JLCPCB will accept to keep the low price.
+ Modify the RCBus80 medium board footprint in Kicad so that pins 1,40,41 & 80 don't throw DRC warnings/errors.
